A soldier alights from a train one day, and their lives change. He gives them a soldier`s promise: He will take them to the land of their dreams. What follows is a hilarious and heartwarming tale of a perilous journey through the desert and the sea, but most crucially through the hinterlands of their mind. A journey that tests and defines them: their courage, their smarts, and the strain of their conflicting ideologies.
